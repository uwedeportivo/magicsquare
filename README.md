solving this [problem](https://mathstodon.xyz/@Elmusfire/110859269669280771) from one of my Mastodon feeds:

```txt 
Imagine a 6 by 6 grid of squares, that can either be black or white.

It has to fulfill the following properties:
1. Each row and column needs to have 3 white and 3 black squares.
2. All black squares have to be orthogonally connected.

Prove that such a grid cannot exist.
```
